# Francis L. Nelson Law — Vercel-ready static site

This is a static HTML site designed to deploy on Vercel with clean routes.

## Deploy
- Import this repo into Vercel (recommended), or use `vercel` CLI.
- The included `vercel.json` adds rewrites so URLs work without `.html`.

## Edit content
- Update the HTML files in the project root.
- Headshot: `assets/francis-headshot.jpg` (compressed for easy pushing)
- Favicon: `assets/balancer.png` (used site-wide)

## Disclaimer
Website content is general information only and is not legal advice.
